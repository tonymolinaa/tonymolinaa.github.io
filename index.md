### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because I was learning how to use github for the first time. I learned how to put a personalized header for the first time on a code. This was the building block for all the labs and taught me the fundamentals. 
* Lab 6 

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of the most interesting because it always came to my mind how online websies would have blackjack. Configuring the correct numbers for each card dealt determining if it was a bust or not. Also learned how to use arguments during this lab which was really helpful.
* Lab 10
    
    Lab 10, part 2 was a different lab it was about counties and being able to find counties in California it was interesting definitley a challenge but a good one.
